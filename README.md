<h1>Smart Home Device Monitoring System</h1>

The specifcation required the creation of a Smart Home Device Monitoring and Management application that would support several specific 'Device Types' including 'Smart Radiator' (which I would be responsible for), 'Smart Plug', 'Smart Bulb' and 'Smart Fan'.

Each 'Device Type' would have shared instance variables and methods with all devices as well as specific instance variables and methods for their own type.

This OOP solution required the use of inheritance, ENUMs as well as full JUnit testing.

A driver class DeviceSearch would also be required to facilite user searches and to control devices - using parameterised methods.
